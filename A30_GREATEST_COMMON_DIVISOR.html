<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_21/main/greatest_common_divisor.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>greatest_common_divisor.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ greatest_common_divisor.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000:  </pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for A using the keyboard.</p>
<p>(Proceed from there inputting B and other program values in accordance to the prompt messages).</p>
<p>STEP_7: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_21/main/greatest_common_divisor_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

step_0: A = 666, B = 303, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 60.

step_1: A = 303, B = 60, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 3.

step_2: A = 60, B = 3, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 3

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is 1024.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is 888.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B using the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 1024, B = 888, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 136.

step_1: A = 888, B = 136, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 72.

step_2: A = 136, B = 72, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 64.

step_3: A = 72, B = 64, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 8.

step_4: A = 64, B = 8, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 8
