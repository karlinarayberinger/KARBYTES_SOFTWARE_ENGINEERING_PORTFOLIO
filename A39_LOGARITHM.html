<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/logarithm.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>logarithm.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ logarithm.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a positive real number, x, to take the logarithm of and which is no larger than 10000: </pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for x using the keyboard. Proceed with the prompts for additional input values which follow.</p>
<p>STEP_7: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/logarithm_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

 * 
 * Note that the base of the logarithmic function

 * Hence, log(x) is approximately the 
 * natural log of x (i.e. ln(x)).
 * 
 * Note that the base of the exponential function

 * 
 * Hence, exp(x) is approximately 
 * x ^ e (where e is approximately Euler's Number).

 * In more succinct terms, x ^ 0 = 1.

 * Note that any number, x, raised to the power of 1 is x.
 * In more succinct terms, x ^ 1 = x.
 * 
 * Note that any whole number, x, 
 * raised to the power of a positive whole number exponent, y, 
 * is x multiplied by itself y times.
 * For example, if x is 2 and y is 3,

 * For example, ln(x) = y is the inverse of (e ^ y) = x 
 * given that the logarithmic base of the function ln(x) is Euler's Number, e 
 * (which is approximately equal to 2.71828182845904524019865766693015984856174327433109283447265625).
 * 
 * Note that the base of a logarithm cannot be 1 because
 * 
 * log_1(x) = y implies (1 ^ y) = x only if x and y are identical and equal to 1.
 * 
 * log_1(2) = y implies (1 ^ y) = 2 when multiplying 1 by itself by any number of times should always yield the result 1; not 2 (or some other non-one number).
 * 
 * As an aside, any non-zero number to the power of zero is one due to the following:
 * 
 * Let a be any non-zero number. Then
 * 
 * (a ^ 3) = a * a * a
 * 
 * and 
 * 
 * (a ^ 2) = a * a
 * 
 * and 
 * 
 * (a ^ 1) = a.
 * 
 * Also, according to the rule of exponents, dividing a power by the base gives the next lower power. Hence,
 * 
 * (a ^ 2) = (a ^ 3) / a = (a ^ 2)
 * 
 * and
 * 
 * (a ^ 1) = (a ^ 2) / a
 * 
 * and, similarly,
 * 
 * (a ^ 0) = (a ^ 1) / a = a / a = 1.
 * 
 * ((0 ^ 1) = 0 * 1 = 0 but (0 ^ 0) = (0 ^ 1) / 0 = 0 / 0 which is technically "not a number").
 * 
 * (Dividing a number by zero is theoretically impossible while multiplying that number by zero (which results in zero) 
 * is theoretically possible because to say that some number is multiplied by zero is logically equivalent to saying 
 * that number occurs zero times. By contrast, dividing some number by zero is logically equivalent to saying that
 * number is compartmentalized into zero equally-sized parts (and none of those parts apparently have any non-zero size and
 * infinitely many of such parts take up any space of any size (whether that size is zero or some positive quantity))).
 *

 * 
 * An algorithm for computing the approximate value of Euler's Number is implemented by the C++ program 
 * featured in the following tutorial web page:

 * 
 *--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Note that the equation (e ^ y) = x is functionally identical to power(e, y) = x 
 * and essentially states that x is the product of multiplying e by itself y times.
 * 
 * x is required to be a positive real number.
 * 
 * logarithmic_base is required to be a positive real number other than one.
 * 
 * This function works by utilizing the following Change of Base (for Logarithms) formula:

Start Of Program
--------------------------------

This C++ program computes the (approximate) logarithm of x in some given logarithmic base.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, x, to take the logarithm of and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for x is 16.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, logarithmic_base, which is a positive real number other than one and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 2.

--------------------------------

result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(16, 2) = 3.998114109039306640625.

x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 16 = 2 ^ 3.998114109039306640625.

x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(2, 3.998114109039306640625) = 16.00697779719589419755720882676541805267333984375.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, logarithmic_base, which is a positive real number other than one and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 2.

--------------------------------

Due to fact that x was determined to be either less than or equal to zero or else greater than 10000, x was set to the default value 1.

result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(1, 2) = 0.0006286196294240653514862060546875.
