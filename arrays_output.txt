The following statements describe the data capacities of various primitive C++ data types:

sizeof(bool) = 1. // number of bytes which a bool type variable occupies

sizeof(char) = 1. // number of bytes which a char type variable occupies

sizeof(int) = 4. // number of bytes which an int type variable occupies

sizeof(long) = 8. // number of bytes which a long type variable occupies

sizeof(float) = 4. // number of bytes which a float type variable occupies

sizeof(double) = 8. // number of bytes which a double type variable occupies

sizeof(bool *) = 8. // number of bytes which a pointer-to-bool type variable occupies

sizeof(char *) = 8. // number of bytes which a pointer-to-char type variable occupies

sizeof(int *) = 8. // number of bytes which a pointer-to-int type variable occupies

sizeof(long *) = 8. // number of bytes which a pointer-to-long type variable occupies
