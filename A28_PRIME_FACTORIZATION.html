<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++</a> program featured in this tutorial web page factorizes some integer, N, into its constituent prime number multiplicative terms (if N is prime number factorizable). Results are printed to the command line terminal interface and to an output text file. Users can input multiple values for N by either choosing to enter another N value or else exiting the program after each value for N is entered.</span></p>
<p>A <strong>prime number</strong> is a natural number which is larger than or equal to 2 and which is the multiplicative product of only itself and 1.</p>
<p>A <strong>composite number</strong> is a natural number which is larger than 1 and which is the multiplicative product of two or more prime numbers.</p>

<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22/main/prime_factorization.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>prime_factorization.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ prime_factorization.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a nonnegative integer value to store in the variable named N which is no larger than 10000 to factor into its constituent prime number multiplicative terms: </pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for N using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_7: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20/main/prime_factorization_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>
