<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/reimann_sum.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>reimann_sum.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ reimann_sum.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, several prompts will appear which ask the program user to select a single-variable function from a menu, x-axis interval end-points, number of equally-sized partitions to divide that interval into, and the method by which to determine the heights of the rectangles which are used to approximate the area bound between that function, those x-axis interval end-points, and the x-axis.</p>
<p>STEP_6: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/reimann_sum_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note that, in the example output file below, the total area of the Reimann Sum rectangles is negative due to the fact that the region bound by the function (i.e. y = f(x) = cosine(x)), the lower x-axis interval boundary (i.e. x = a = -10), the upper x-axis interval bound (i.e. x = b = 0), and the x-axis (i.e. y = 0) is mostly below the x-axis (which means that those rectangle areas sum up to one &#8220;negative&#8221; area). By contrast, the area bound by the x-axis, the cosine function, x = 0, and x = 10 is mostly above the x-axis (which means that those rectangle areas count as one &#8220;positive&#8221; area).</em></p>
