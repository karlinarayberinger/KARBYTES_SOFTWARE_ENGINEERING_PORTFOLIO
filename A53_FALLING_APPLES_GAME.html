<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single web page application</a> featured in this tutorial is a simple <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a> which simulates apples falling out of the sky while the player attempts to catch as many of the falling apples as possible (before they touch the ground) in a basket. During the game, one hundred &#8220;apples&#8221; each fall at a constant velocity along a path which is perpendicular to the ground and such that the horizontal position of each apple with respect to a fixed point on the ground is &#8220;randomized&#8221;. The player controls a rectangular basket which moves along the ground to the left or right by clicking arrow buttons on the screen or by pressing the left and right arrow keys on the computer keyboard. Each time an apple is caught, the score is incremented by one. Also, the total number of seconds elapsed per game round is displayed. This software application was deliberately left as barebones as possible (with plenty of comments in the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript</a> file) so that users can customize the code to make the game more logically elaborate and aesthetically sophisticated such as adding sound effects, different apple types, different falling rates for some apples, and increasing difficulty levels as the player advances in the game).</span></p>
