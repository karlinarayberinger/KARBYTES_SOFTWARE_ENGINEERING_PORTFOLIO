The program user inputs exactly two values: S (which is the total number of elements to include in the array) and T (which is the total number of unique natural number values which each element of the array can be instantiated as exactly one of per program runtime instance).</span></p>

// Each of the four sorting algorithms featured in <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20/main/sort_compare.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort_compare.cpp</a> have different algorithm efficiencies. Hence, the following sorting algorithm function runtimes vary significantly despite the fact that those functions operate on the same input array.

<hr>
<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20/main/sort_compare.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>sort_compare.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ sort_compare.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number value to store in the variable named S which is no larger than 1000 and which represents the total number of elements to include in an array of int-type elements named A: </pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for S using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_7: After a value for S is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number value to store in the variable named T which is no larger than 1000 and which represents the total number of unique states which each element of A can represent exactly one of per instant: </pre>
<p>STEP_8: Enter a value for T using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_9: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_20/main/sort_compare_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

Start Of Program
--------------------------------

Enter a natural number value to store in the variable named S which is no larger than 1000 and which represents the total number of elements to include in an array of int-type elements named A: 

The value which was entered for S is 1000.

S := 1000. // number of consecutive int-sized chunks of memory to allocate to a one-dimensional array of S integers named A.

--------------------------------

Enter a natural number value to store in the variable named T which is no larger than 1000 and which represents the total number of unique states which each element of A can represent exactly one of per instant: 

The value which was entered for T is 100.
