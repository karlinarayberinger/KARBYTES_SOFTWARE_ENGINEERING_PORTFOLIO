<p><strong>PROGRAM_INTERPRETATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the Python <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/logarithm.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>logarithm.py</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the Python program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Run the program by entering the following command:</p>
<pre>python3 logarithm.py</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program interpretation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the Python interpreter:</p>
<pre>sudo apt update</pre>
<pre>sudo apt install python3</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the Python program is booted up, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a positive real number, x, to take the logarithm of and which is no larger than 10000: </pre>
<p>STEP_5: Enter a value for x using the keyboard. Proceed with the prompts for additional input values which follow.</p>
<p>STEP_6: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/logarithm_output_two.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

# This function returns the result of the following calculation: 
# log_b(x) where log_b is the logarithmic function whose base is b (and where b is logarithmic_base).
# 
# A logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation. 
# 
# For example, ln(x) = y is the inverse of (e ^ y) = x 
# given that the logarithmic base of the function ln(x) is Euler's Number, e 
# (which is approximately equal to 2.71828182845904524019865766693015984856174327433109283447265625).
# 
# Another example of a logarithm is the following:
# log_2(16) = 4
# (which implies 4 ^ 2 = 16).
#
# Note that the base of a logarithm cannot be 1 because
# 
# log_1(x) = y implies (1 ^ y) = x only if x and y are identical and equal to 1.
# 
# log_1(2) = y implies (1 ^ y) = 2 when multiplying 1 by itself by any number of times should always yield the result 1; not 2 (or some other non-one number).
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# As an aside, any non-zero number to the power of zero is one due to the following:
#
# Let a be any non-zero number. Then
# 
# (a ^ 3) = a * a * a
# 
# and 
# 
# (a ^ 2) = a * a
# 
# and 
# 
# (a ^ 1) = a.
# 
# Also, according to the rule of exponents, dividing a power by the base gives the next lower power. Hence,
#
# (a ^ 2) = (a ^ 3) / a = (a ^ 2)
# 
# and
#
# (a ^ 1) = (a ^ 2) / a
#
# and, similarly,
#
# (a ^ 0) = (a ^ 1) / a = a / a = 1.
#
# ((0 ^ 1) = 0 * 1 = 0 but (0 ^ 0) = (0 ^ 1) / 0 = 0 / 0 which is technically "not a number").
# 
# (Dividing a number by zero is theoretically impossible while multiplying that number by zero (which results in zero) 
# is theoretically possible because to say that some number is multiplied by zero is logically equivalent to saying 
# that number occurs zero times. By contrast, dividing some number by zero is logically equivalent to saying that
# number is compartmentalized into zero equally-sized parts (and none of those parts apparently have any non-zero size and
# infinitely many of such parts take up any space of any size (whether that size is zero or some positive quantity))).
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# x is required to be a positive real number.
# 
# logarithmic_base is required to be a positive real number other than one.
#
# This function works by utilizing the following Change of Base (for Logarithms) formula:
#
# log_b = ln(x) / ln(b)

x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 81.0 = 3.0 ^ 4.000000000004087.


x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(3.0, 4.000000000004087) = 80.99999999965758.


--------------------------------


The value which was entered for x is 10000.0.


The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 10000.0.


result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(10000.0, 10000.0) = 1.0.


x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 10000.0 = 10000.0 ^ 1.0.


x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(10000.0, 1.0) = 10000.0.


--------------------------------


The value which was entered for x is 10000.0.


The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 9999.0.


result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(10000.0, 9999.0) = 1.0000038753251448.


x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 10000.0 = 9999.0 ^ 1.0000038753251448.


x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(9999.0, 1.0000038753251448) = 4954.047976737616.


--------------------------------


The value which was entered for x is 8.0.


The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 0.0.


Due to the fact that logarithmic_base was out of range, logarithmic_base was set to the default value 2.


result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(8.0, 2) = 3.000000000038476.


x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 8.0 = 2 ^ 3.000000000038476.


x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(2, 3.000000000038476) = 7.999999999970146.


--------------------------------


The value which was entered for x is -444.0.


The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 1.0.


Due to the fact that x was out of range, x was set to the default value 1.


Due to the fact that logarithmic_base was out of range, logarithmic_base was set to the default value 2.


result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(1, 2) = 0.0.


x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 1 = 2 ^ 0.0.


x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(2, 0.0) = 1.


--------------------------------


The value which was entered for x is 666.0.


The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 3.33.


result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(666.0, 3.33) = 5.404057966802309.


x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 666.0 = 3.33 ^ 5.404057966802309.


x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(3.33, 5.404057966802309) = 665.7618761047137.


--------------------------------


The value which was entered for x is 8.0.


The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 2.0.


result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(8.0, 2.0) = 3.000000000038476.


x = logarithmic_base ^ result --&gt; 8.0 = 2.0 ^ 3.000000000038476.


x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(2.0, 3.000000000038476) = 7.999999999970146.
