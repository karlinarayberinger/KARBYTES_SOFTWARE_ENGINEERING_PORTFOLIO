<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++</a> program featured in this tutorial web page illustrates how to use pointer variables to instantiate arrays during program runtime. The program first prompts the user to enter a natural number value to store in a variable named S. Then the program prompts the user to enter a natural number value to store in a variable named T. Then the program will create an array named A consisting of exactly S integer values such that each of those S integer values is a random nonnegative integer value which is no larger than (T &#8211; 1). Then the program will sort the values which are stored in A in ascending order using the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bubble Sort</a> algorithm. Then an array consisting of exactly T elements will store the number of times each unique value occurred as an element value of A. Finally, a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">histogram</a> (i.e. bar graph) representation of C will be created using the values of B.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">A <strong>pointer</strong> is a variable which stores the memory address of a variable. An <strong>array</strong> is a variable which is used to store some natural number of data values of the same data type. At the hardware level, an array comprised of N elements whose data type is DATA_TYPE is a contiguous block of DATA_TYPE multiplied by N memory cells.</span></p>

<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/main/arrays.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>arrays.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ arrays.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number, S, for representing the number of elements to include in an array which is no larger than 1000:</pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for S using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_7: Another prompt for keyboard input will appear after the first input value is entered:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number, T, for representing the number of unique states which each element of the array can store exactly one of which is no larger than 1000:</pre>
<p>STEP_8: Enter a value for T using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_9: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/main/arrays_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

--------------------------------

STEP_5: CREATE A DYNAMIC ARRAY WHICH IS NAMED C AND WHICH IS COMPRISED OF T POINTER-TO-CHAR TYPE VALUES.

--------------------------------

// Declare one pointer-to-pointer-to-char type variable.
char ** C;

// Allocate T contiguous pointer-to-char-sized chunks of memory and store the memory address of the first pointer-to-char-sized chunk of memory, C[0], inside the pointer-to-pointer-to-char type variable named C.
C = new char * [T];

// C is a two-dimensional array which depicts a histogram (i.e. bar graph) such the length of the ith row is identical to the value stored in B[i].
for (i = 0; i &lt; T; i += 1)
{
    C[i] = new char [B[i]];
    for (k = 0; k &lt; B[i]; k += 1) C[i][k] = &#039;X&#039;;
}

--------------------------------

C = 0x5607d3786a90. // memory address of C[0]

C[0] = XXXXXXXXXXX.		// &amp;C[0] = 0x5607d3786a90. (memory address of the first byte-sized memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous byte-sized memory cells allocated to C[0]).

C[5] = XXXXXXX.		// &amp;C[5] = 0x5607d3786ab8. (memory address of the first byte-sized memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous byte-sized memory cells allocated to C[5]).
C[6] = XXXXXXXX.		// &amp;C[6] = 0x5607d3786ac0. (memory address of the first byte-sized memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous byte-sized memory cells allocated to C[6]).

C[8] = XXXXXXXXXX.		// &amp;C[8] = 0x5607d3786ad0. (memory address of the first byte-sized memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous byte-sized memory cells allocated to C[8]).
C[9] = XXXXXXX.		// &amp;C[9] = 0x5607d3786ad8. (memory address of the first byte-sized memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous byte-sized memory cells allocated to C[9]).

--------------------------------

STEP_6: RELEASE MEMORY WHICH WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DYNAMIC ARRAYS NAMED A, B, AND C.

--------------------------------

// De-allocate memory which was assigned to the dynamically-allocated array of S int type values.
delete [] A; // Free up S contiguous int-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named A.

De-allocate memory which was assigned to the dynamically-allocated array of T int type values.
delete [] B; // Free up T contiguous int-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named B.

// De-allocate memory which was assigned to the dynamically-allocated array of T pointer-to-char type values.
for (i = 0; i &lt; T; i += 1) delete [] C[i]; // Free up B[i] char-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named C[i].
delete [] C; // Free up T contiguous pointer-to-char-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named C.
