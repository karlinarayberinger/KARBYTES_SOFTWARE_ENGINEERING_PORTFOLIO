 * Reverse engineer the cmath pow() function 
 * using the following properties of natural logarithms:
 * 
 * ln(x ^ y) = y * ln(x).
 * 
 * ln(e ^ x) = x. // e is approximately Euler's Number.
 * 
 * Note that the base of the logarithmic function 
 * used by the cmath log() function is e.
 * 
 * Hence, log(x) is approximately the 
 * natural log of x (i.e. ln(x)).
 * 
 * Note that the base of the exponential function
 * used by the cmath exp() function is
 * (approximately) Euler's Number.
 * 
 * Hence, exp(x) is approximately 
 * x ^ e (where e is approximately Euler's Number).
 * 
 * Note that any number, x, raised to the power of 0 is 1.
 * In more succinct terms, x ^ 0 = 1.
 * 
 * Note that any number, x, raised to the power of 1 is x.
 * In more succinct terms, x ^ 1 = x.
 * 
 * Note that any whole number, x, 
 * raised to the power of a positive whole number exponent, y, 
 * is x multiplied by itself y times.
 * For example, if x is 2 and y is 3, 
 * 2 ^ 3 = power(2, 3) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
 * 
 * Note that any whole number, x, 
 * raised to the power of a negative exponent, y, 
 * is 1 / (x ^ (-1 * y)).
 * For example, if x is 2 and y is -3,
 * 2 ^ -3 = power(2, -3) = 1 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 1 / 8 = 0.125.

// Function to compute logarithm base logarithmic_base of x

/**
 * This function returns the result of the following calculation: 
 * log_b(x) where log_b is the logarithmic function whose base is b (and where b is logarithmic_base).
 * 
 * A logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation. 
 * 
 * For example, ln(x) = y is the inverse of (e ^ y) = x 
 * given that the logarithmic base of the function ln(x) is Euler's Number, e 
 * (which is approximately equal to 2.71828182845904524019865766693015984856174327433109283447265625).
 * 
 * Note that the base of a logarithm cannot be 1 because
 * 
 * log_1(x) = y implies (1 ^ y) = x only if x and y are identical and equal to 1.
 * 
 * log_1(2) = y implies (1 ^ y) = 2 when multiplying 1 by itself by any number of times should always yield the result 1; not 2 (or some other non-one number).
 * 
 * As an aside, any non-zero number to the power of zero is one due to the following:
 * 
 * Let a be any non-zero number. Then
 * 
 * (a ^ 3) = a * a * a
 * 
 * and 
 * 
 * (a ^ 2) = a * a
 * 
 * and 
 * 
 * (a ^ 1) = a.
 * 
 * Also, according to the rule of exponents, dividing a power by the base gives the next lower power. Hence,
 * 
 * (a ^ 2) = (a ^ 3) / a = (a ^ 2)
 * 
 * and
 * 
 * (a ^ 1) = (a ^ 2) / a
 * 
 * and, similarly,
 * 
 * (a ^ 0) = (a ^ 1) / a = a / a = 1.
 * 
 * ((0 ^ 1) = 0 * 1 = 0 but (0 ^ 0) = (0 ^ 1) / 0 = 0 / 0 which is technically "not a number").
 * 
 * (Dividing a number by zero is theoretically impossible while multiplying that number by zero (which results in zero) 
 * is theoretically possible because to say that some number is multiplied by zero is logically equivalent to saying 
 * that number occurs zero times. By contrast, dividing some number by zero is logically equivalent to saying that
 * number is compartmentalized into zero equally-sized parts (and none of those parts apparently have any non-zero size and
 * infinitely many of such parts take up any space of any size (whether that size is zero or some positive quantity))).
 *

 * An algorithm for computing the approximate value of Euler's Number is implemented by the C++ program 
 * featured in the following tutorial web page:
 * 
 * https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/eulers_number_approximation/
 * 
 *--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Note that the equation (e ^ y) = x is functionally identical to power(e, y) = x 
 * and essentially states that x is the product of multiplying e by itself y times.
 * 
 * x is required to be a positive real number.
 * 
 * logarithmic_base is required to be a positive real number other than one.
