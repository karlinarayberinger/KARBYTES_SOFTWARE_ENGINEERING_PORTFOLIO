This C++ program computes the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers and prints the steps involved.

--------------------------------

Enter the first of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named A) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for A is 10.

--------------------------------

Enter the second of two natural numbers (which will be stored in an int type variable named B) which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for B is 9.

--------------------------------

Computing the greatest common divisor of A and B using the Euclidean algorithm...

step_0: A = 10, B = 9, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 1.

step_1: A = 9, B = 1, gcd(A,B) = A % B = 0.

The greatest common divisor of A and B is 1

--------------------------------
