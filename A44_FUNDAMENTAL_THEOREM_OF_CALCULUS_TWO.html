<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> program featured in this tutorial web demonstrates the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</a> (which shows how the derivative of a function is essentially the inverse of the integral of that function).</span></p>
<p><strong>The Python program file which is featured in this tutorial web page has many common attributes with the C++ source code file featured on the tutorial web page of this website named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/fundamental_theorem_of_calculus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUNDAMENTAL_THEOREM_OF_CALCULUS</a>. Unlike that C++ source code file, this Python program generates slightly different output messages (to the command line terminal and to the generated and/or overwritten output file).</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>derivative</strong> is a function which describes the rate at which some function&#8217;s output changes when that function&#8217;s input changes (at a particular input value).</p>
<p>A physics example of a derivative is the velocity function, v(t), which is derived from a position function, s(t):</p>
<p>v(t) = s'(t)</p>
<p>s(t) describes the position of an object in space at a particular point in time, t.</p>
<p>v(t) describes the rate at which that object&#8217;s position is changing at a particular point in time, t.</p>
<p>Another physics example of a derivative is the acceleration function, a(t), which is derived from a velocity function, v(t).</p>
<p><p>a(t) = v'(t) = s&#8221;(t) // s&#8221;(t) is &#8220;s double prime of t&#8221;</p>
<p>The <strong>integral</strong> of some function, y = f(x), on the x-axis interval [a,b] is the area of the region bounded by y = f(x), x = a, x = b, and y = 0.</p>

<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the Python <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/fundamental_theorem_of_calculus.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>trigonometric_functions.py</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the Python program file is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Run the program by entering the following command:</p>
<pre>python3 fundamental_theorem_of_calculus.py</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program interpretation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the Python interpreter:</p>
<pre>sudo apt update</pre>
<pre>sudo apt install python3</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the Python program is booted up, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>
Enter the number which corresponds with one of the following functions:

0 --&gt; f(x) = x^2

1 --&gt; f(x) = x^3

2 --&gt; f(x) = sin(x)

3 --&gt; f(x) = cos(x)

4 --&gt; f(x) = sqrt(x)

5 --&gt; f(x) = 2x + 3

Enter Option Here: 
</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Enter a value for which corresponds with the function of choice using the keyboard.</p>
<p>Proceed with inputting the next input values according to the prompts.</p>

    f'(x), which is referred to as f prime, represents the derivative of a function, f(x).

    f'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2 * h)

    h is the small step size used to calculate the difference between the function values which 
    are relatively close together (in terms of function input values).

    According to ChatGPT-4, the default parameter for h is assigned "1e-5 (which is 0.00001) as a 
    typical choice for h, as it is small enough to provide a precise approximation without introducing 
    too much numerical error due to floating-point precision."

    A physics example of a derivative is the velocity function, v(t), 
    which is derived from a position function, s(t):

    v(t) = s'(t) 

    s(t) describes the position of an object in space at a particular point in time, t.

    v(t) describes the rate at which that object's position is changing at a particular point in time, t.

    Another physics example of a derivative is the acceleration function, a(t),
    which is derived from a velocity function, v(t).

    a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t) // s''(t) is "s double prime of t"

Start Of Program
--------------------------------


This Python program demonstrates the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.


--------------------------------


Enter the number which corresponds with one of the following functions:

0 --&gt; f(x) = x^2

1 --&gt; f(x) = x^3

2 --&gt; f(x) = sin(x)

3 --&gt; f(x) = cos(x)

4 --&gt; f(x) = sqrt(x)

5 --&gt; f(x) = 2x + 3

Enter Option Here: 

The value which was entered for option is 1.

The single-variable function which was selected from the list of such functions is f(x) = x^3.

--------------------------------


Enter a value to store in variable a (which represents the left end of the x-axis interval): 

The value which was entered for a is -10.0.

Enter a value to store in variable b (which represents the right end of the x-axis interval): 

The value which was entered for b is 10.0.

Enter a value to store in variable n (which represents the number of equally-sized partitions to divide the x-axis interval into): 

The x-axis interval which was selected to partition is [-10.0, 10.0].

The selected number of equally-sized partitions to divide that interval into is 1000.

--------------------------------


Enter a value to store in variable x (which represents a point inside of the selected x-axis interval): 

The value which was entered for x is 8.0.

--------------------------------


f(x) = f(8.0) ≈ 512.0.


f'(x) = f'(8.0) ≈ 191.99999999557346. // derivative


--------------------------------


whole_interval_area ≈ 2.8066438062523957e-13 // value of the definite integral on [a,b]


S f(x) dt (interval [a,b]) = selected_interval_area = -1475.9985420000014 // value of the definite integral on [a,x]


--------------------------------


original_function ≈ derivative(integ, x) --&gt; original_function(8.0) = 511.9995141171784
